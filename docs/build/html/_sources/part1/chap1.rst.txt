1.1 What Is AI?
---------------

Some definitions of artificial intelligence:

* Thinking Humanly
* Acting Humanly
* Thinking Rationally
* Acting Rationally

1.1.1 Acting humanly: The Turing test approach
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The **Turing test**, proposed by Alan Turing, was designed as a thought 
experiment that would sidestep the philosophical vagueness of the question
"Can a machine think?"
The computer would need the following capabilities to pass the Turing test:

* **natural language processing** to communicate successfully in a human language
* **knowledge representation** to store what it knows or hears
* **automated reasoning** to answer questions and to draw new conclusions
* **machine learning** to adapt to new circumstances and to detect and extrapolate patterns

To pass the **total Turing test**, a robot will need

* **computer vision** and speech recognition to perceive the world
* **robotics** to manipulate objects and move about.

1.1.2 Thinking humanly: The cognitive modeling approach
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

We can learn about human thought in three ways:

* **introspection**--trying to catch our own thoughts as they go by
* **psychological experiments**--observing a person in action
* **brain imaging**--observing the brain in action
  
The interdisciplinary field of **cognitive science** brings together computer 
models from AI and experimental techniques from psychology to construct precise
and testable theories of the human mind.

1.1.3 Thinking rationally: The "laws of thought" approach
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Several Greek schools developed various forms of **logic**, which provides a
precise notation for statements bout objects in the world and the relations
among them.

1.1.4 Acting rationally: The rational agent approach
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

An **agent** is just something that acts.
A **rational agent** is one that acts so as to achieve the best outcome or, when 
there is uncertainty, the best expected outcome.
